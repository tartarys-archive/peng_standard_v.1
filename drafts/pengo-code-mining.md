Pengo Code Mining

The Pengo system introduces a distinct form of value extraction referred to as Pengo Code Mining.

Each historical Pengo banknote is uniquely identifiable through a fixed and verifiable set of attributes:

denomination

series identifier

serial number

year of issue

Together, these attributes form a deterministic and non-replicable code.
From this code, a unique digital identifier can be generated.

Unlike computational mining systems, Pengo Code Mining does not rely on probabilistic processes or increasing energy expenditure. Instead, it is based on proof of existence and proof of origin.

Finite and Exhaustible Source

The total supply of Pengo codes is historically closed.
No new banknotes can be issued, and the number of recoverable units naturally decreases over time due to loss and degradation.

This establishes Pengo Code Mining as a deflationary extraction process by design.

Physical Anchor

Each mined code is inseparably linked to a physical carrier: an original historical artifact stored under custodial protection.

This physical anchoring:

prevents arbitrary duplication

eliminates purely speculative issuance

ensures long-term auditability

The digital representation cannot exist independently of the physical deposit.

Cost Structure

The cost of Pengo Code Mining is not computational, but human and logistical:

discovery and recovery

transport and verification

archival digitization

secure custodial storage

As a result, the process is orders of magnitude less energy-intensive than traditional proof-of-work systems, while remaining resistant to mass automation.

Cultural Preservation as Mining

Pengo Code Mining may be understood as a process that converts historical memory into structured digital value.

Where conventional mining consumes energy to secure a network, Pengo Code Mining preserves cultural artifacts to secure meaning.

Each mined unit represents:

a recovered fragment of monetary history

a verifiable physical–digital bridge

a finite cultural signature

Position Within the Pengo Standard

Pengo Code Mining constitutes the foundational extraction mechanism of the Pengo Standard.

It precedes:

NFT issuance

token (jeton) allocation

community participation rights

No Pengo unit may be minted without the prior successful completion of the code mining process and its physical verification.
